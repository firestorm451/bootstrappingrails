          <p>.... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
              yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
              say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
              there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
              you're gonna need it ... badly... So .... Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell
              you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You
              can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh .... And Alex, try to get your
              mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
              manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
              complete and total surrender. In fact, a lot of people think the movie's
              called 'Wild Thing', as they should. But there are parts of me that is
              hopper, because my motto now is 'You either love, or you hate ... and you
              must do so violently.' And the reason you must hate violently is because
              ... and you have to hate everyone that is not in your family, because
              they're there to destroy your family, and they will come at you in all
              forms and shapes. And that was actually, you know, one of the few
              compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.</p>
